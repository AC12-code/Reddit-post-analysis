# Reddit-post-analysis
Conducted sentiment analysis using Python, NLTK, and VADER, and performed frequency distribution of Reddit posts from various subreddits (r/technology, r/politics, r/funny). Data was scraped using PRAW(Python Reddit API Wrapper). Used pre-trained word2vec models and GloVe vectors to analyse semantic similarities and generate coherent sentences.
